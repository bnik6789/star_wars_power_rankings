TROS is actually a masterclass of how to completely remove all stakes from a film by moving the plot only through contrivance. At every corner there are instaces of, caves that hold the map to the last wayfinder,
big bads being ressurected under the flimsly explaination of "the dark side of the force is a pathway to many abilities that some consider to be unnatural", and older characters showing up as an ex machina, not once but TWICE. 
All of these have no function other than to sloppily progress the plot forward while simutanioulsy adding some sort of confusing fan service.

One scene I want to point out in particular is that of the discovery that where the Rebels discuss "Somehow, Emporer Palpatine has returned". Firstly, they recieve this information
directly from a spy who is a defector from the First Order, not a spy they sent in, but just some random agent sending them information. The Rebels decide to just take this serious information at 
face value, having any sort of discussion that this could be some sort of trick or trap. Secondly, in the discussions of how its possible that Palpatine has somehow retuned, a person posits, 
"Cloning, Dark Magic, secrets only the Sith knew." Everyone procceeds to agree with this!! Cloning?? A secret that only sith users know about??? Apparantley there is some sort of mass 
amnesia to forget that there was a point in time where there was an entire clone army. That same clone army which accelerated the fall of the Jedi Order, that same clone army that Palpatine was in charge of!   


Some areas of the movie do shine however, such as the perfectly crafted scene wherein the knights of Ren were introduced. As an casual audience member myself, I really 
appreciated the part where we were told that the party of brutes and warriors accompanying Kylo Ren where call the "Knights of Ren, cool".
